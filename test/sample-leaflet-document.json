Life expectancy has risen from 33 in 1960 to 78 in 2023, essentially matching the United States. Per capita income has climbed from a few hundred dollars at the start of reform to over $13,000 today.

Foreign direct investment into China has plummeted by over 90% in recent years, while Chinese investment in the U.S. has sharply declined, redirecting capital toward Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America."

China offers proof that another model can work: state-led development, long-term planning, massive infrastructure investment, and selective integration with global markets, all while maintaining political autonomy. Whether one admires this model or not, its success cannot be denied, and its implications ripple far beyond East Asia."

The Great Reckoning may be about China right now, but in the larger arc of history, it is about far more: about a world no longer revolving around familiar centers, about the need to find steadiness without the comfort of inherited myths, about recognizing that the stories some of us told ourselves about modernity may have been too narrow, too self-serving, too small for the world we're actually living in."

But it does require holding them more lightly, arguing for them more persuasively, and demonstrating their worth through performance rather than proclamation. The choice, for the West, is not between resistance and surrender, but between thoughtful adaptation and stubborn denial—between strengthening institutions through honest self-examination or watching them weaken through willful blindness to new realities. The world has fundamentally changed. The question is whether we will meet this moment with the rigorous clarity it demands."
